*//FOLLOW GYRO ANGLE 
kp, ki, and kd are the PID constants.

speed is the desired speed of the midpoint of the robot

target_angle is the angle we want to maintain

sleep_time is how many seconds we sleep on each pass through
the loop. This is to give the robot a chance to react to the new motor settings. This should be something small such as 0.01 (10ms).
follow_for is called to determine if we should keep following the
desired angle or stop. This function will be passed self (the current MoveTank object). Current supported options are: - follow_for_forever - follow_for_ms
**kwargs will be passed to the follow_for function*//

from ev3dev2.motor import OUTPUT_A, OUTPUT_B, MoveTank, SpeedPercent, follow_for_ms

from ev3dev2.sensor.lego import GyroSensor

# Instantiate the MoveTank object
tank = MoveTank(OUTPUT_A, OUTPUT_B)

# Initialize the tank's gyro sensor
tank.gyro = GyroSensor()

# Calibrate the gyro to eliminate drift, and to initialize the current angle as 0
tank.gyro.calibrate()

try:

    # Follow the target_angle for 10000ms
    tank.follow_gyro_angle(
        kp=11.3, ki=0.05, kd=3.2,
        speed=SpeedPercent(30),

        ms=10000
